## Filecoin Solidity Utils

Libraries and helper methods used when testing parts of the FEVM.

* `Address.sol` contains helpful utilities for converting between addresses and Actor IDs.
* `Actors.sol` wraps the call_actor and call_actor_by_id precompiles. (I really didn't test this one at all)

Use at your own risk!
